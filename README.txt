REQUIREMENTS

At run-time the Orbital library needs a standard Java Virtual
Machine. Some parts need JVM 1.4+, but most are satisfied with
1.2+. No additional libraries are required at run-time.

In order to build all parts of the Orbital library, examples, tests
and additional files, you need some additional software. See description
of build.xml for details.
