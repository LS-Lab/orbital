<p>The apparent advantage of this 3D Vector Graphics Applet is its relative
small size. So in comparison with VRML for Java it can be loaded very quickly
over the network. In that way it is ideal for simple 3D-effects. Another
advantage is that this Applet can also be reused. In comparison with animated
GIF-files containing rendered 3D-effects, this VectorAnimation Library
not only can provide dynamic behaviour, but can also be spread over a home
page. So it must only be loaded once and can display several 3D Animations
distributed over whole web site with only a little scene loading effort.
<p>Of course, the obvious disadvantage is that unlike GIF-Animations this
Vector Animation Library cannot render that detailed. So one must balance
load efficiency and level of detail.
<p>Ideal is a combination of VRML-, VectorAnimation- and animated GIF-Effects.
