Example Applets and Applications
(In the examples subdirectory.)

Examples, with source code, of programming with the features Orbital
library for Java. Contains several simple examples that will help you
step right into action with Orbital library. Nevertheless might need
some further experimenting with it to enjoy its full power.

The applets need the orbital library. Unfortunately, appletviewer
ignores the CLASSPATH. So consider unpacking orbital*.jar into your
%JAVA_HOME%\jre\classes directory. If the orbital*.jar files are on the
CLASSPATH, some of the applets can also be called directly as applications
by invoking
