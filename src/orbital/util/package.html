<body>

Provides basic utility classes useful to ease several programming tasks.
<p>Also defines classes for set operations and more general collection
operations.</p>
<p>Filters provides function implementations that can be applied on a collection to return a
filtered collection.<br />
Selection is a more sophisticated algorithm that selects data from a Collection,
its syntax resembles SQL <b>SELECT</b> queries.</p>
<p>
Advanced technology classes, worth a closer look are:
<ul>
  <li>Activation class for conditional exception handling.</li>
  <li>StreamMethod is the base class for sophisticated architectural connector
    coroutines that are concurrent and even streamed, but very easy to
    implement.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Common filters are these:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Filters.all</li>
  <li>Filters.first</li>
  <li>Filters.ranged(int min,int max)</li>
  <li>Filters.top</li>
</ul>
