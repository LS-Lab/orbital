<body>

Contains an architecture for strategies that select objects with regard to their
weight.
<p>(Not to be mixed up with the Design Pattern &quot;Strategy&quot;).
<p>Basic interface is the Selection, its implementations select from an
Enumeration of Objects (<i>or Collection</i>) according to their weight. The
Algorithm for weighting an Object is done by user defined implementations of the
interface Weighting.
<p>The strategy is selected by Evaluation that evaluates a Selection of all
Objects already weighted by <b>Evaluation</b>. The Weighting is delegated to a
user defined Weighting instance.
<p>The Selection algorithms implemented are:
<ul>
  <li>Selection.Selecting.best()</li>
  <li>Selection.Selecting.min()</li>
  <li>Selection.Selecting.max()</li>
  <li>Selection.Selecting.sum()</li>
</ul>
