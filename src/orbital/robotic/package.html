<body>

Responsible for simulating movements of all moving things like robots and
figures.
<p>Basically, 2D Position and Direction classes are included along with a Moving
base class to be sub classed by all moving things.<br>
A moving thing can perform certain Moves or translate explicitly. A Move in turn
consists of a sequence of characters represented as a String which is wrapped in
an instance of the Move class.<br>
Data collected on the basis of a robotic exploration can be collected in a Table
like the simple Map. Even a generic 2D geometric Search class is provided which
uses Predicates as criteria.
