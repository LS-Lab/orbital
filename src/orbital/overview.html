<body>

The Orbital library provides extensional services and classes for Java. This
foundation class library is strictly generalized in order to satisfy the
requirements of high reusability. Many common problems can be solved very easily
with its adaptable components.
<h2>Overview</h2>
The Orbital library is divided into these sets of sub packages:
<ol>
  <li>Core Packages</li>
  <li>Extension Packages</li>
</ol>
Additional implementation specific classes and execution tools, which are
subject to change without notice, are kept in:
<ol start="4">
  <li>Implementation Packages (sub packages of orbital.moon)</li>
</ol>
All classes are contained in sub packages of <b>orbital</b>.
<h2 id="Install">Installation</h2>
<h3>System Requirements</h3>
Since the Orbital library is pure Java, you can apply it on virtually any
machine, provided that you have already installed a Java Virtual Machine. To
ensure maximum usage of the Orbital library, you should use a Java Virtual
Machine and Runtime library that is compatible with <a href="http://java.sun.com">Sun's
JDK 1.4+</a> for the Java 2 Platform.<br>
However most (but not all) parts of the library also support JDK 1.2+ or
earlier.
<h3>Download the Archive</h3>
Prior to installing, you must accept the License Agreement. Then you can <a href="http://beam.to/Twiph/">download</a>
the archive containing the Orbital library from World Wide Web.
<h3>Installing the Orbital library</h3>
<p>Since the Orbital library is written completely in Java, most of the library
is ready for use just after including it in the class-path (see below how). This
can be achieved in a multitude of ways depending solely on your preference.
However, if you intend to use some very specialized features, you might want to
configure some system properties as well in addition to placing the library on
the class-path.</p>
<p>In order to get the Orbital library into your class-path, you should either:
<ul type="circle">
  <li>Use the Orbital library setup wizard for configuration. To start the setup
    wizard, call</li>
  <ul>
    <kbd>java -jar orbital-ext.jar</kbd>
  </ul>
  <li>Or copy the <a href="#orbitalStar.Jar">orbital*.jar</a> files as an
    &quot;installed&quot; extension to the <tt>lib/ext</tt> directory of the
    Java 2 platform runtime environment of your JVM.</li>
  <li>Or place the <a href="#orbitalStar.Jar">orbital*.jar</a> archive files
    containing the library classes anywhere on your class path that is set in
    the <tt>CLASSPATH</tt> environment variable.</li>
  <li>Or specify the <a href="#orbitalStar.Jar">orbital*.jar</a> files as a
    &quot;bundled&quot; extension with a relative path in the manifest attribute
    <tt>Class-Path</tt> of your program's deployment JAR archive for all
    applications and applets that use it.</li>
  <li>Or add all <a href="#orbitalStar.Jar">orbital*.jar</a> files as an
    additional library to your preferred Integrated Development Environment
    (IDE). Refer to its documentation for details.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most Java Virtual Machines work best when the classes are only kept at one
single location. So consider simply storing it as an &quot;installed&quot;
extension. Also make sure that no old release of Orbital library is placed in
the class-path.</p>
<p>To accelerate loading any Java applets that use the Orbital library from the
internet, the archive files are split into several parts. JAR indexing then
enables Java Plug-ins with a JVM of 1.3+ to transfer only those files that are
necessary. Also specifying the Orbital library as a download extension in the
applet's manifest makes sure that the JAR files are only transferred once at
all.</p>
<p>The <dfn id="orbitalStar.Jar">orbital*.jar</dfn> archive files consist of
<ol>
  <li>orbital-core.jar which contains the core packages of Orbital library.</li>
  <li>orbital-ext.jar which contains the extension packages, implementation
    packages and additional resources.</li>
  <!-- li>remote/orbital-dl.jar which contains Jini&trade; client side download interfaces.
    They are only needed for <i>distributed object model </i>environments and
    should be placed in an appropriate path on the web server then. Refer to
    Jini&trade; documentation for details.</li -->
</ol>
<h3 id="SystemProperties">Configuring Orbital library with System Properties</h3>
There are some additional system properties that help configuring the Orbital
library for special applications. They can either be set statically in the
system or user properties file of your Java Virtual Machine. Or they are set
individually with the help of the <tt>-D</tt> command line switch of the Java
interpreter.
<ul>
  <!-- li>Adjoint logging capabilities:
    <ul>
      <li><tt>orbital.Adjoint.loglevel</tt> - one of the various logging levels to
        use.
        Refer to the <a href="orbital/Adjoint.html#SystemProperties">documentation</a> for
        details on valid values for loglevel.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>SP pluggable specification testing:
    <ul>
      <li><tt>orbital.SP.reporter</tt> - name of the class to use as the system
        wide SP_Reporter.
        Refer to the <a href="orbital/SP.html#SystemProperties">documentation</a> for details.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li -->
  <li>Math precision settings:
    <ul>
      <li><tt>orbital.math.MathUtilities.defaultPrecisionDigits</tt> - the
        default number of precision digits (for display etc.). Refer to the <a href="orbital/math/MathUtilities.html#SystemProperties">documentation</a>
        for details.</li>
      <li><tt>orbital.math.MathUtilities.defaultTolerance</tt> - the default
        tolerance for two numbers to be treated equal. (experimental) Refer to
        the <a href="orbital/math/MathUtilities.html#SystemProperties">documentation</a>
        for details.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Features</h2>
The Orbital library is a general extension to the java packages in the form of a
foundation class library. It specifies several central concept classes (<i>Core
Packages</i>), and whole class networks that contain extended components,
generic abstractions, and additional services of reusable Java classes (<i>Extension
Packages</i>). See:
<ul>
  <li><a href="features.shtml">Summary of all features</a></li>
  <li><a href="recommendations.html">Pointers and hints recommending very
    important classes</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Feedback">Bug Reports and Feedback</h2>
Feel free to send a mail to submit a bug or request a feature. To directly
submit a bug or request a feature, mail to:
<ul>
  <li><tt><a href="mailto:api@gmx.net">api@gmx.net</a></tt></li>
</ul>
Please make sure that you specify information as detailed as possible. You
should also include a brief description of the operating system, compiler
(respectively Java Virtual Machine) and any additional libraries you are using
in case they might conflict with the Orbital library.
