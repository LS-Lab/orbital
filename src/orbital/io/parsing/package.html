<body>
Provides a generic Scanner &amp; Parser interface along
with an implementation containing regular expression patterns and configurable
lexical token declarations.
<p>Basic classes are the abstract Scanner and Parser classes that are the
base classes for all lexical scanners and grammar parsers.
<p>For a sharp distinction, Strings are kept in instances of the classes
Token and Symbol.
<p>With a Reader as input for a Scanner, the output will be represented
as a TokenSequence which is the input for a Parser which consecutively
outputs Symbols. RegExAutomata also processes over a TokenSequence.
<p>As a lexical Scanner, RegScanner is included which is capable of scanning
definite Tokens as well as indefinite regular Tokens specified with regular
expressions.

<h3>
<a id="CONTENT"></a>Scanning and Parsing</h3>
To interpret a complex language, the technique of Scanners and Parsers
can be used. Before interpreting a text written in a (formal or informal)
language, it is evident that the text is broken into separate Tokens. This
lexical process is done by the Scanner which must know what Tokens to recognize.
Then the resulting TokenSequence is checked and the Tokens are semantically
grouped. This grammatical process is done by the Parser which must&nbsp;
know rules for the grammar of the language. Having all Tokens scanned and
semantically grouped according to grammatical rules, the interpretation
of the statements (or sentences) can start depending upon the specific
task.
<h3>
<a id="Token"></a>The Tokens</h3>
Tokens consist of
<ul>
<li>
a grammatical <b>type </b>which they belong to, like the type <i>TAG</i> of all
HTML starting tags.</li>

<li>
a <b>symbol </b>that they match, like <i>Assurance</i></li>

<li>
a <b>token</b>-String which they raise when they occur, like the HTML tag <i>BODY</i>.</li>
</ul>
Tokens, if declared literally in a file are specified as:
<ul><i>type</i><b>|</b><i>symbol</i><b>|</b><i>token</i><b>|</b></ul>
Two kinds of Tokens exist:
<ul>
<li>
<b>definite </b>Tokens, explicitly naming a String that they match to,
like <i>Assurance</i></li>

<li>
<b>indefinite</b> or <b>regular</b> Tokens, matching to all Strings that
fulfil a certain Regular Expression, like <i>[A-Z][0-9]*</i></li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a id="Scanner"></a>The Scanner</h3>
The Scanner is a base class that consecutively scans in Tokens from an
input Reader or Scanner. The token declarations must be provided, either
directly as an array or indirectly with the token declaration syntax in
a (File-)Reader.
<br>This implementation scans <b>definite</b> Tokens explicitly declared
in the lexical token declaration file (like <i>Assurance) and</i> <b>regular</b>
Tokens specified as a Regular Expression (like [A-Z][0-9]*).
<br>Reading from an input Reader, the Scanner first tries to match the
longest definite Token possible. If no Token matches or no alternativeToken()
can be found for the current symbolPart, then all Regular Expression specifications
are run through a non deterministic Automata matching Regular Expressions
if possible.
<h3>
<a id="Parser"></a>The Parser</h3>
A Parser is capable of parsing a TokenSequence and returning the Symbols
resulting from the tokens. For HTML the Parser is rather simple in a way that
it simply concatenates the Tokens of type WORD and CIRCUM. Additionally
he recursively starts another HTML Parser when a Token of type TAG is found
and finishes of, if the matching end tag of type ETAG (if necessary) is found.
