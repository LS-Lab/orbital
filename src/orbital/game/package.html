<body>
Provides a generic package to describe a game, its rules and
strategy for a computer player.
<p>Basic classes are Figure and Field. Figure represents a chess piece
to play with and specifies its legal moves. Field contains all Figures
on a field and allows them to move. A Field is displayed in the AWT-component
Gameboard which also enables mouse dragging.
<p>The rules are defined with a game-specific implementation of GameRules.
<p>Strategic weighting, which is useful for calculating the best computer ("AI")
moves, is done with derivatives of FieldWeighting, FigureWeighting,
MoveWeighting. However, there is a much faster implementation with
AlphaBetaPruning that also tends to be easier to use.
