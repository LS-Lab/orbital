<body>
Provides a generic package to describe a game, its rules and
strategy for a computer player.
<p>Basic classes are Figure and Field. Figure represents a chess piece
to play with and specifies its legal moves. Field contains all Figures
on a field and allows them to move. A Field is displayed in the AWT-component
Gameboard which also enables mouse dragging.</p>
<p>The rules are defined with a game-specific implementation of GameRules.</p>
<p>Computer player strategies can be implemented by using
AlphaBetaPruning. In addition, there still is the old way of
calculating the best computer ("AI") moves, with derivatives of
FieldWeighting, FigureWeighting, MoveWeighting. However, the much
faster implementation with AlphaBetaPruning also is far easier to
use. A library with standard heuristics can be obtained as well.</p>
