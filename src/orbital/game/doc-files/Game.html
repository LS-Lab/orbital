<title>Call the Game applet</title>

<p>
Call the Game applet within a html page per
<div style="white-space: pre">
&lt;applet code="orbital.game.GameView.class" width="<var>250</var>" height="<var>250</var>"&gt;
  &lt;param name="gameName" value="<var>the Name of the Game</var>"&gt;
  &lt;param name="gameRules" value="<var>GameRulesImpl</var>"&gt;
  &lt;param name="player-2" value="<var>argumentForComputerSecondPlayer</var>"&gt;
&lt;/applet&gt;
</div>
</p>

<p>
To run this applet, either use the appletviewer, or a
very modern Browser with Java Plug-in,
or run it as an application by calling
<pre>
java Game gameRules=<var>GameRulesImpl</var> player-2=<var>argumentForComputerSecondPlayer</var>
</pre>
</p>

<p>
To set league <code><var>i</var></code> to a human player,
<tt>player-<var>i</var></tt> must be set to the string <span
class="String">null</span>, or not set at all. Otherwise the argument
is passed to the computer player.</p>

<p>
In order to extend the basic game applet, you can write a sub class with the
appropriate features. An example of a running game is kept in the
<tt>examples/SChess</tt> directory. Its computer is kept very simplistic though,
to provide a very simple introduction of how to use it. Refer to the Orbital library
web site for additional examples.</p>
