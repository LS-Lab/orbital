<p>
Call the Game applet within a html page per
<div style="white-space: pre">
&lt;applet code="Game.class" width="<var>250</var>" height="<var>250</var>"&gt;
  &lt;param name="gameName" value="<var>the Name of the Game</var>"&gt;
  &lt;param name="gameRules" value="<var>GameRulesImpl</var>"&gt;
  &lt;param name="aIntelligence" value="1"&gt;
&lt;/applet&gt;
</div></p>

<p>
To run this applet, either use the appletviewer, or a
very modern Browser with Java Plug-in,
or run it as an application by calling
<pre>
java Game gameRules=<var>GameRulesImpl</var> aIntelligence=1
</pre>
</p>

<p>
To enable two player game, the <tt>aIntelligence</tt> setting must be reduced to zero.
To enable computer auto play mode, the <tt>aIntelligence</tt> setting is increase to the
total number of players.</p>

<p>
In order to extend the basic game applet, you can write a sub class with the
appropriate features. An example of a running game is kept in the
<tt>examples\SChess</tt> directory. Its computer is kept all to simple though,
to provide a very simple introduction of how to use it. Refer to the home page
for additional examples.</p>
