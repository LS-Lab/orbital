Orbital library's basic classes.
<p>The Orbital library is contained in the package orbital and its sub packages.
It is compact and highly integrated and as such, should not be segregated.
Because of the mutual dependencies of the classes and packages the Orbital
library is designed to be applied as a whole. Only the top layers (Core
Packages, or Extension Packages including Core&nbsp; Packages, or Service&nbsp;
Packages including Core and Extension Packages) can be use separately. Refer to
the major documentation overview for details.</p>
