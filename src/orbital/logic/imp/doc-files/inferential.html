<h2>Inference relations</h2>
Basing on the logic sequence relation W &#8872; O several other inference
relations can be defined.<br>

<p>Most general inference relations are these:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&#8866; <i>deduces</i>: the deduction relation is true if a formula
    deduced (<i>conclusion</i>), can be proven on the basis of more general
    knowledge. The knowledge deduced is true. For classical logic systems, this
    relation is sometimes called logic sequence (&#8872;).
  <li><span class="inference">&#8826;</span> <i>induces</i>: the induction
    relation is true if a formula induced (<i>hypothesis-rule</i>), fits with
    all examples of the formulas. The rule formula induced does not need to be
    true for other examples.
  <li><span class="inference">&#8827;</span> <i>abduces</i>: the abduction
    relation is true if a formula abduced (<i>hypothesis-cause</i>), explains a
    factual formula on the basis of the general knowledge formulas (rules).
</ul>
<p>
Be aware that in another context, the relation <span class="inference">&#8826;</span>
is called subsumption where <span class="Formula">s <span class="inference">&#8826;</span> g</span>
is true if s is more special than g.</p>
