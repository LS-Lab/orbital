Genetic Algorithms simulate nature on a very abstract level
to get solutions for sophisticated problems. The simulation corresponds
to the current understanding of genetic processes. Especially promising
is the usage of genetic algorithms or evolutionary programming for problems where no constructive
solution algorithms are known or where they would be far too complex
to implement.<p>With genetic algorithms, problems can be solved by checking
whether one of the trial solutions (in the abstract population of data)
already is a good solution to the problem. They check whether a member (called
an abstract genome) fulfils all criteria required for a good solution
of the problem. To create such a solution, trial genomes will be genetically
recombined to form new genomes that are new members of the abstract
population. Starting with some random genomes, finally one solution
will be found - if our basic assumption that the evolution solves our problem
in an efficient way, is true.</p>
<p> Genetic algorithms are searching through an <i>arbitrary search
space</i> both for exploration and exploitation purpose. In fact,
genetic algorithms perform a parallel hill-climbing search through
state space (of genomes) maximizing a given fitness function. However,
these parallel solutions are occasionally combined to build a new
solution of (hopfully) joint force.  The search is parallel since
several members of a population are considered. Under certain
assumptions (Goldberg. <i>Genetic Algorithms in Search, Optimization
and Machine Learning</i>. Addison-Wesley.  1989), it can be shown that
genetic algorithms allocate searching resources in an optimal way. By
the way, genetic algorithms can even be seen as a form of
reinforcement learning.</p>
<p>
Prior to using a genetic algorithm to solve a problem you need to decide:<ol>
  <li>Which genetic representation to use for the members in state space?</li>
  <li>What fitness-weighting to use as an objective function to maximize?</li>
  <li>Perhaps define customized reproduction operators for the Gene representation,
   in order to support convergence with domain knowledge.</li>
  <li>Decide which selection function to apply.</li>
</ol>
<p>Important classes are:
<ul>
<li>
GeneticAlgorithm and its sub classes that run some variations of a genetic
algorithm.</li>

<li>
GeneticAlgorithmProblem is an interface to implement for using a genetic
algorithm in a convenient way.</li>

<li>
Genome represents a member of the population and is compound of several
instances of Gene interface.</li>

<li>
Gene sub classes provide holders for different information contained in an
abstract genome.&nbsp;</li>

<li>
Population is a collection of all current Genomes</li>
</ul>
