Genetic algorithms simulate nature on a very abstract level to get solutions for
sophisticated problems. The simulation corresponds to the current understanding
of genetic processes. Especially promising is the usage of genetic algorithms or
evolutionary programming for problems where no constructive solution algorithms
are known or where they would be far too complex to implement.
<p>With genetic algorithms, problems can be solved by checking whether one of
the trial solutions (in the abstract population of data) already is a good
solution to the problem. They check whether a member (called an abstract genome)
fulfils all criteria required for a good solution of the problem. To create such
a solution, trial genomes will be genetically recombined to form new genomes
that are new members of the abstract population. Starting with some random
genomes, finally one solution will be found - if our basic assumption that the
evolution solves our problem in an efficient way, is true.</p>
<p>Genetic algorithms are searching through an <em>arbitrary search space</em>
both for exploration and exploitation purpose. In fact, genetic algorithms
perform a parallel hill-climbing search through state space (of genomes)
maximizing a given fitness function. However, these parallel solutions are
occasionally combined to build a new solution of (hopefully) joint force. The
search is parallel since several members of a population are considered. Under
certain assumptions (<cite>Goldberg. <i>Genetic Algorithms in Search,
Optimization and Machine Learning</i>. Addison-Wesley. 1989</cite>), it can be
shown that genetic algorithms allocate searching resources in an optimal way. By
the way, genetic algorithms can even be seen as a form of reinforcement
learning.</p>

<p>Prior to using a genetic algorithm to solve a problem you need to decide:
<ol>
  <li>Which genetic <strong>representation</strong> to use for the members in state space.</li>
  <li>What fitness-<strong>evaluation</strong> to use as an objective function to maximize <em>and</em>
    guide search.</li>
  <li>Perhaps, define customized <strong>reproduction</strong> operators for the gene
    representation, in order to support convergence with domain knowledge.</li>
  <li>Decide which <strong>selection</strong> function to apply.</li>
</ol>
<p>Important classes are:
<ul>
  <li><a href="GeneticAlgorithm.html">GeneticAlgorithm</a> and its sub classes
    that run some variations of a genetic algorithm.</li>
  <li><a href="GeneticAlgorithmProblem.html">GeneticAlgorithmProblem</a> is an
    interface to implement for using the genetic algorithms in a convenient way.</li>
  <li><a href="Genome.html">Genome</a> represents a state in the state space and
    is compound of several instances of gene.</li>
  <li><a href="Gene.html">Gene</a> sub classes provide holders for different
    information contained in an abstract genome.&nbsp;</li>
