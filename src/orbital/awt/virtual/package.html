Virtual Reality with abilities for 3D Graphics and 3D World management.
<p>The GrVirtual extension v_Graphics is a virtual graphics interface that
projects 3D drawing and redirects it to a normal 2D Graphics instance. Several
projection types are specified in the sub-classes v_PerspectiveGraphics,
v_MathematicGraphics and v_ZGraphics.
<p>Management is based on the v_Component class which is the base class for all
Objects normally displayed on a v_Graphics instance. Several instances of
v_Component are grouped together in a v_Container which has the same semantics
(extends the v_Component Interface) as a regular v_Component.
<p>As a specific v_Component, there is the 3D Point v_Vertex. As specific
v_Containers (with special 3D semantics) there are v_Polygon, v_Object, v_World.
