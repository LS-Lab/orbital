<h2>Important Features</h2>
The Orbital library is a general extension to the java packages in the form of a
foundation class library. It specifies several central concept classes (<i>Core
Packages</i>), and whole class networks that contain extended components,
generic abstractions, and additional services of reusable Java classes (<i>Extension
Packages</i>).
<p>Especially promising contents are logical functors and their mathematical
counter part with numerical and symbolic mathematics, as well as functional
evaluation and several algorithmic templates including search and planning.</p>
<h3>These packages include:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>mathematical, numerical and statistical utilities, and conceptual
    interfaces for mathematics.</li>
  <li>Enhanced numerical mathematics, and even symbolic mathematical
    calculations are possible.</li>
  <li><i>Arithmetic objects</i> with uniform mathematical operations like +, -,
    *, /, ^. This enables us to use a uniform calculation with various
    arithmetic implementation objects which include matrices, vectors and scalar
    types like integers, rational, real and complex numbers. Even full symbolic
    calculations and modulo calculations are now possible.</li>
  <li>Mathematical functions are generalized to fit the requirements of
    functional operations and allow symbolic derivation and sometimes
    integration. They now extend the basic logical functors instead to maximize
    compatibility. Additionally mathematical functions can be handled like
    arithmetic objects whenever this general view is of advantage.</li>
  <li>Several algorithmic templates are provided which is extremely helpful for
    rapid prototyping. Those algorithmic templates also include the most
    important (blind and heuristic) state space search algorithms. Even some
    implementations of Planning algorithms are provided.</li>
  <li>Term rewrite sytem facility achieved with fixed point operations of term
    unification and substitution.</li>
  <li>a generic framework for logical systems using extended logic with
    classical operators. Note that this is a framework in the sense of logic,
    but not in the sense of software architecture. Therefore it provides you
    with all logical operations without restricting the architecture of your
    application.</li>
  <li>algorithmic template frameworks including evolutionary (genetic) algorithm
    implementation</li>
  <li>A parser for logical and mathematical expressions including &#955;-operator
    notation of &#955;-calculus.</li>
  <li>functional evaluation with functor interfaces and function notation
    classes.</li>
  <li>a generic board game abstraction framework.</li>
  <li>graphical user interface (GUI) utilities and AWT-Extension Java Beans.</li>
  <li>lightweight 3D worlds graphics engine.</li>
  <li>I/O-Extensions.</li>
  <li>Scanner&amp;Parser base classes for simple parsing jobs.</li>
  <li>some document encoding and formatting classes.</li>
  <li>concurrent synchronous and asynchronous connectors that supports a
    programming style with coroutines.</li>
  <li>And some more...</li>
</ol>

<!-- <p>
Additionally, the orbital library contains interfaces for several <i>distributed
object model</i> environments: the <i>orbital library services</i>. Environments
that are supported to be inter connectable with the Orbital library include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>CORBA with internet inter ORB protocol (IIOP).</li>
  <li>RMI with Java Remote Method Protocol (JRMP).</li>
  <li>Port Servers with socket based internet text protocol.</li>
  <li>jini fluid objects via <a href="../../../info/jini_env.html">jini</a>
    distributed objects model architecture.</li>
</ul>
<ul type="CIRCLE">
  <li>More information is contained in the documentation.</li>
  <li>Orbital services for Servlets will soon be added.</li>
</ul>
</p>
-->

<p>Release 0.9.5+ of Orbital library is capable of JAR indexing which is a new
feature that will result in less consumption of network bandwidth for applets.
See documentation of JDK 1.3+ for more details on how to use it.</p>
