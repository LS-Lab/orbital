<h2>Important Classes</h2>
This document provides pointers to the most useful classes of the Orbital library
along with a brief description of possible applications. It helps you
jump right into action, profiting from the various features of the Orbital
library, spontaneously. Nevertheless, there are still large parts of the library
which - however useful - can not be discussed here, briefly. To discover them
you should still browse the primary documentation.
<h3>Pointers, Links and Hints</h3>
<ol>
  <li><a href="api/orbital/algorithm/template/GeneralSearch.html">GeneralSearch</a>
    is the main class for general purpose state-space search algorithms
    applicable in various problems. For applying a multitude of different
    algorithms for general search problems it is sufficient to model the specific
    problem as a state-model. In programming terms, this is achieved by
    implementing a common interface shared amongst all implementations.
    Especially conservative artificial intelligence problems profit from this
    collection of ready-to-use algorithms. Some example applications of <code>GeneralSearch</code>
    are provided, including <a href="examples/Algorithms/EightPuzzle.java"><samp>8-Puzzle</samp></a>,
    and <a href="examples/Algorithms/RubicsCube.java"><samp>Rubic's Cube</samp></a>.
    A very simple example is provided as <a href="examples/Algorithms/SimpleGSP.java"><samp>SimpleGSP</samp></a>.</li>
  <li>Several additional <a href="api/orbital/algorithm/template/package-summary.html">algorithmic
    templates</a> are available that follow the same scheme of providing the
    algorithms for problem solution and deferring the problem-specific part into
    an interface. These include backtracking problems, greedy algorithms, Divide
    and Conquer, dynamic programming, MDPs. See the documentation of these algorithms for more details.
    Also see the <a href="examples/Algorithms"><samp>Algorithms</samp></a> subdirectory of the
    examples, as well as <a href="examples/Algorithms/RobotNavigation.java"><samp>robot
    navigation</samp></a>, and <a href="examples/Knapsack/KnapsackDP.java"><samp>Knapsack</samp></a>.</li>
  <li><a href="api/orbital/util/StreamMethod.html">StreamMethod</a> is a class that
    introduces concurrent and streamed connectors that turn programming multi-threaded methods with multiple return-values or collections into
    something almost as simple as conventional single threaded programming.
    Additionally, instead of affecting the implementation of a stream method,
    its aspect of synchronicity is merely parametric. A short instructive code
    snippet with tree iterators is contained in the documentation of
    StreamMethod. Examples showing how to apply stream methods and comparing the different modes
    of stream method connectors are provided in the <a href="examples/SimpleDemos/"><samp>SimpleDemos</samp></a>
    directory, whilst a real world example is an asynchronous variation of the <a href="examples/Algorithms/EightPuzzle_asynchronous.java"><samp>8-Puzzle</samp></a>
    implementation.</li>
  <li><a href="api/orbital/awt/CustomizerViewController.html" class="@todo too sterile">CustomizerViewController</a>
    has the capability of inventing a standard customizer for JavaBeans from
    scratch just-in-time. With just a few calls to reflection and introspection, a default customizer view
    appears that allows changing the properties of any Bean very easily. If
    available, a bean's corresponding BeanInfo class is queried for property descriptions
    etc. Even incredibly sophisticated user dialogs can be created by providing a BeanInfo class with
    extended information, or register new PropertyEditors. An application that
    uses the default customizer to allow the user change its settings is kept in
    the <a href="examples/Propertizer/ProgApplication.java"><samp>Propertizer</samp></a> subdirectory of the examples.</li>
  <li><a href="api/orbital/math/Arithmetic.html">Arithmetic objects</a>  are
    accessible through a common unified interface for arithmetic operations like
    +,-,*,/,^. Like with polymorphic operators, the advantage of using the
    Arithmetic interface for implementing an algorithm or function is, that it
    will run unchanged for other algebraic data types of&nbsp; the same
    structure and laws. This way, many operations will as well work with
    ordinary double value, specialized integer, complex-valued or matrix-valued
    data through one single interface. Implementations of arithmetic objects
    already support matrix, vector, complex number, functional and even symbolic operations.
    Some examples with numerical algorithms, statistics and matrices are provided in the <a href="examples/SimpleDemos/"><samp>SimpleDemos</samp></a> directory.
    To see how easy a single function can be applied to a multitude of different
    arithmetic data types, see <a href="examples/Functional/FunctionalTest.java"><samp>FunctionalTest</samp></a>. </li>
  <li><a href="orbital/math/functional/Function.html">Mathematical functions</a>
    have a general interface for functions in mathematics with the abilities of
    (even symbolic) differentiation and integration. Along with several
    compositional functionals that are aware of symbolic derivatives as well,
    comes a bunch of common function implementations. What often proves very
    useful, too, are the generalized mathematical <a href="api/orbital/math/functional/Operations.html">operations</a>
    provided, which can handle arithmetic objects as well as functions. There is
    also a parser for mathematical expressions in the implementation package <code><a href="api/orbital/moon/logic/package-summary.html">orbital.moon.logic</a></code>.
    Apart from the <a href="examples/Functional/"><samp>Functional</samp></a>
    subdirectory of the examples, functions are also used in some of the <a href="examples/SimpleDemos/"><samp>SimpleDemos</samp></a>.</li>
  <li>Logic <a href="api/orbital/logic/functor/Functor.html">functions, predicates</a>
    and <a href="api/orbital/logic/functor/Functionals.html">functionals</a>
    found the basis for the major part of this library, and also form the
    foundations of the mathematical functions API. However, they have
    proven to be that useful in such a broad range of situations that you may
    well want to apply them directly, too. What you can expect them to do is
    provide a framework for generalized call-backs, allow functional operations
    like composition, argument binding, list mapping, function nesting, and
    argument swapping. They also give you essential tools for structural
    composition of functions and common schemes of recursion, as well as fixed
    point operations. Last but not least, you will get term substitution
    functions and a term rewrite system for Java.
    Although the examples include a directory <a href="examples/Functional/"><samp>Functional</samp></a>
    just for functions, you can also admire them in real world use in the other
    examples, due to their virtual omnipresence.</li>
  <li><a href="api/orbital/logic/imp/Logic.html" style="@todo">Logic</a>  is a
    generic logic framework and has an implementation of classical logic and
    fuzzy logic. It provides you with a general interface to logic systems. As with all logic functions you can choose between different notations
    (prefix, infix, postfix,...) for your logical junctors' string representation.
    There is also an extensible
    parser for logical functions and mathematical expressions in the
    implementation package <code><a href="api/orbital/moon/logic/package-summary.html">orbital.moon.logic</a></code>. The documentation
    of the logic package is itself very extensive and self-contained, while some examples of applications are
    provided in the <a href="examples/Logic/"><samp>Logic</samp></a>
    subdirectory. Also note that there is a binary tool (in the <tt>bin</tt>
    subdirectory) for invoking classical logic and the mathematical parser from
    the command line. Call
    &quot;<kbd>ClassicalLogic --help</kbd>&quot; for help.</li>
