<h2>Templates</h2>
<p>This library uses template extended Java classes. Some of
the classes have been altered slightly, so that the advantages of C++&nbsp; templates can be applied.
Apart from compile-time type-safety, one advantage of templates is that redundant classes have eventually been removed now to reduce the conceptual weight.</p>
<p>With template classes of Generic Java, the user has the choice:&nbsp;</p>
<ol type="I">
  <li>Template classes can either be used as ordinary Java classes with a
    conventional Java compiler working on generic-type Object, without
any change to the source code.</li>
  <li>Alternatively, some part of the code can make use of templates by using the Generic Java compiler.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you decide to use these enhanced template features, refer to the <a href="http://www.cis.unisa.edu.au/~pizza/">Generic
Java home</a> to get the Generic Java compiler and additional documentation about templates and reusing previous code with retrofitting.</p>
